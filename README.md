# IMDB-top100-2018-scrap
This is a basic Scrap of IMDB top 100 movies of 2018 site. All of the 'None' values are replaced by a general 'Nil' string using Python so that a balanced dataframe is obtained.
The scrapped data of the site is saved in the repository in the form of dataset which was exported using Pandas Dataframe.
Use it, edit it or suggest me any changes you thing is good or better. Anything will be appreciated.
